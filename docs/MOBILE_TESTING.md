## 🧪 How to Test Auto-Delete (Empty Workout > 3h)

To test the auto-delete feature for empty abandoned workouts:

1. **Create test workout** (via Firebase Console or app):
   - Start a workout but don't add any sets
   - Set `startedAt` to 4+ hours ago
   - Make sure `completedAt` and `cancelledAt` are null/undefined
   - Make sure `exercises` object is empty or has no sets with data

2. **Expected behavior**:
   - Refresh the app
   - Resume banner should NOT appear
   - Workout should be automatically deleted from Firebase
   - Check Firebase Console - document should be gone
   - Console should log: "🗑️ Deleted abandoned empty workout: [name]"

3. **Verification**:
   - Check Firebase Console to confirm deletion
   - Check browser console for deletion log
   - Workout should not appear in history/calendar

## 🔍 Console Check

Open browser DevTools and check for:
- [ ] No errors in Console tab
- [ ] No 404 errors in Network tab
- [ ] Service worker registered in Application tab
- [ ] Firebase initialized successfully
- [ ] All modules loaded without errors

## 📊 Testing Record

| Date | Tester | Device | OS | Browser | Version | Result | Notes |
|------|--------|--------|----|---------|---------| -------| ------|
| | | | | | v3.20 | ✅/❌ | |

## 🛠️ If Something Breaks

1. Check browser console for errors
2. Note the exact steps to reproduce
3. Check if error persists after hard refresh (Ctrl+Shift+R or Cmd+Shift+R)
4. Try incognito mode
5. Check Firebase console for quota/errors
6. Verify network connectivity
7. Report with: device, browser, OS, steps to reproduce, console errors

**Testing Strategy**: Go through each section systematically. Mark items as you test them. Note any issues immediately. Test critical user flows first (auth, workout execution, history).

**Pro Tip**: Test during an actual gym session to catch real-world issues!
